										<p>Kuma-Ko is about so much more than websites. It is a space where all creative passions can breathe and thrive. No one is one-dimensional, so neither is Kuma-Ko. Here you’ll find creative works from graphic design to illustration to photography. The content we produce for you will evolve with our team’s passions and interests.</p>

										<div id="dan">
											<span class="image left"><img src="images/Dan.png" alt="" /></span>
											<p><strong>Dan</strong><br><b>Actual Panda</b><br><br>Dan is our head developer. He mostly works in the shadows, making seedy deals with the code demons. In his spare time, he cooks food for everyone and fears the ocean more than most people fear Armageddon. You can often find Dan watching Parks and Recreation or Sword Art Online with some crappy Chinese food. The less authentic the better!</p>
										</div>

										<div id="steph">
											<span class="image right"><img src="images/Steph.png" alt="" /></span>
											<p><strong>Stephani</strong><br><b>The Adventurer</b><br><br>Steph keeps things spicy. She deals with the front end of all code, making it as perfect as humanly possible. When she isn’t working, she’d rather travel or jump out of a plane. Possibly at the same time? Steph loves Thai food, and is a gifted viola player. Her show suggestions include Sherlock, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Avatar: The Last Airbender.</p>
										</div>

										<div id="sara">
											<span class="image left"><img src="images/Sara.png" alt="" /></span>
											<p><strong>Sara</strong><br><b>Token Asian</b><br><br>Sara is the head designer for Kuma-Ko. She is obsessed with all things furry and feathered, and thoroughly enjoys shoujo anime. To make Sara happy, give her paper, copics, and sushi and sit her down in front of Love! Live. When she isn’t working, she likes to draw and learn Japanese. We never said she wasn’t a complete otaku.</p>
										</div>

										<div id="tyler">
											<span class="image right"><img src="images/Tyler.png" alt="" /></span>
											<p><strong>Tyler</strong><br><b>Lives Here</b><br><br>Tyler is your typical gazebo-loving, DC-fanatical carnivore. When he isn’t hanging out with his goddaughter, he is our marketing-agent-slash-in-house-counselor. He is a literal psychologist, by the way. Tyler’s true loves include flamingos, men’s fashion, and Salisbury steaks. He feels that shows such as Duck Tales and Justice League have shaped him into the person he is today.</p>
