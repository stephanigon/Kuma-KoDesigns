						          				<p>ABLE/ISD is an online Instructional Development Design workshop. <br><br> Developed and driven by training executive, Kristy Bloxham PhD, the ABLE/ISD program uses on-line tools to engage you with a group of other students in an intense six-week learning experience. Students from all over the world are welcome to participate. <br><br>Each instructional design concept presented during the workshop is enforced by a real life project the students will complete either individually, or with a group. These projects will give you experience that will help build your body of work. <br><br> This program has assignment deadlines, and regular group meetings, which take place online through video calls. <br><br> The weekly group meeting schedule is Monday, Wednesday, and Friday 7-9pm MT. Students use other hours for individual work. These meeting times are non-optional and real-time with other students. Tuition is $2,400.</p>
